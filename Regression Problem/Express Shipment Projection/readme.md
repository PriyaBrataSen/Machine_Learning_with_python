# Project Description:
 ## This project is the modification of the time series forecast of express shipping units from distribution centers. This project takes into consideration other features beside time to project the shipments.
 
# Objectives:
 ## 1. Getting the shipment prediction at warehouse, customer and carrier level. 
 ## 2. To refelct the demand, we include order information as a features.
 ## 3. To reflect, different uncertain economic events and customer specific days, we include different variables such covid period, way day and prime day.
 ## 4. In the time series forecast, we were getting around 85-87% accuracy. One of the major goal of this prediction is to get better accuracy

# Methodology:
 ## We used 9 features year,month,week,warehouse,customer, total orders, covid period, way day, prime day to predict the number of shipping units for our express department. 
 ## We did exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of data, how the variables are associated and what features has major importance on explaining the shipping units.
 ## Based on our exploratory analysis, we decided that non-linear ensamble techniques will be better fit for our dataset. We tested both random forest and xgboost and chose random     forest to use for the final prediction. 
 ## We also tuned the parameters of Random Forest model to get better accuracy
